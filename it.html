			<p class="paragraph" ><i>In this site we will try to talk about Different sport<b>In our modern world, we are always hearing about the latest scores and updates from all major sports teams, whether it is professional, collegiate level, or anything else. For many of us, our lives revolve around the athleticism and competitiveness that makes up sports. Ever since we were children, many of our parents had us involved in different sports or activities that gave us the chance to love them or hate them. But what many people do not notice, is that sports and games play a very important role in our lives.

There are many values that we can obtain from playing, watching, or being involved with sports. The first take-away is the educational value that we receive. When we play games and sports, we grow a sense of discipline on ourselves and our teammates. We make sure that we do all that we can, while our teammates are doing all that they can do as well. They teach us that every minute or second is valuable, and they can truly decide fate. Also, sports and games help us reach goals and overcome challenges in life, because they taught us how to work hard, win, and accept loss when it happens.

Secondly, there are emotional values of sports and games. For many, when there is stress or built up anger, physical activity helps us relieve our emotions and find calming peace. As stated previously, sports teach us how to win and lose. With this, we learn how to control our emotions when handed the end result of a game. More emotional values, are that our sense of team spirit grow. Not only does this help with time on the field or court, but it also helps with when we enter the workforce and must work with others.

Aside from educational and emotional values, we also gain in physical aspects as well. Maintaining our health and physical fitness is very vital to our well-being, so engaging in activities like sports and games truly helps. Along so, playing sports increases our endurance, which leads us into the fact that they also helps us get stronger by helping us lose weight and any unwanted fat, and gain muscle. Studies have also shown that mentally, we get stronger as well, because by exercising and playing sports, we increase our blood flow to all parts of the body, especially the brain, and that helps us with our neuroplasticity.

In all, sports, games, and all physical recreations play a huge role in our everyday lives. From childhood, when our parents put us on teams, to today, where many of us love to play sports and games at all time, we have nothing but positive results and values to take away. Gaining educational, emotional, physical, and mental values are all amazing take-aways from sports, that show to be huge assets in our everyday life. Whether you have a favorite sport or not, go find something you like to play and engage in it!
